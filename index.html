         <p>Lake Champlain extends from the lower end of Champlain Canal at Whitehall, NY, north for about 112 miles to the International boundary at Rouses Point, NY. The north end of the lake outlets north through Riviere Richelieu and Canal de Chambly to the St. Lawrence River. The principal ports on the lake are Port Henry, NY, at the south end, Burlington, VT, and Plattsburgh, NY, near midlake, and Rouses Point, NY, at the north end.</p>
         <p>An unmarked dumping ground with a least reported depth of 35 feet is 3 miles N of the entrance to Huron Harbor. Dangers.–An extensive area of fish net stakes is off the entrance to Huron Harbor. Harbor Regulations.–A speed limit of 6 mph (5.2 knots) is enforced in the harbor except in the outer harbor where the speed limit is 10 mph (8.7 knots). (See 33 CFR 162.155 and 207.570, chapter 2, for regulations.)
         </p>
         <p> A special anchorage is on the west side of the lake in Deep Bay. (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.8(i), chapter 2, for limits and regulations.) Channels.–The south 37 miles of Lake Champlain, from Whitehall north to Crown Point (44°01.8'N., 73°25.8'W.), is a narrow arm. The south 13 miles of this arm, from Whitehall north to Benson Landing, is filled with a marshy flat traversed by a narrow channel of open water. A Federal project provides for a 12-foot channel through this reach. In September 2008, the controlling depths in the channel were 2 feet (7½ feet at midchannel) to Benson Landing. Above Benson Landing, natural deep water is available to Crown Point. The entire narrows, from Whitehall to Crown Point is well marked by lights and buoys.

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">  
              <p>North from Crown Point for about 75 miles to Rouses Point, Lake Champlain is deep and wide. Prominent points and shoals throughout the lake are marked by lights and buoys.
              </p>
              <p>Following is a description of the principal ports and tributaries of Lake Champlain. Between Barber Point (44°09.2'N., 73°24.3'W.) and The Four Brothers 20 miles north, marinas are on the west side of the lake at Westport, NY, and Essex, NY, and on the east side of the lake on the south side of Thompsons Point and in McNeil Cove. Marine railways to 50 tons, lifts to 35 tons, and the usual services are available.
              </p>
              <p>Special anchorages are on the east side of Thompsons Point and at Essex, NY. (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.8 (b) and (g), chapter 2, for limits and regulations.) Otter Creek flows into the east side of the lake about 6.5 miles northeast of Barber Point. A depth of about 6 feet can be carried by small craft for 8 miles to Vergennes, VT. Boquet (Bouquet) River, 3 miles north of Essex, is navigable by small motorboats for about 1 mile during high water stages. Willsboro Bay, on the west side of the lake west of The Four Brothers, is enclosed on the east by Willsboro Point. Marinas on the east side of the bay provide transient berths, gasoline, diesel fuel, electricity, ice, sewage pump-out, mast-stepping service, launching ramps, and hull and engine repairs.
              </p>
              <p>Shelburne Bay, east of The Four Brothers, is enclosed on the west by Shelburne Point. Two special anchorages are on the west side of the bay. (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.8(c) and (c–1), chapter 2, for limits and regulations.) A boatyard on the west side of the bay provides transient berths, gasoline, diesel fuel, water, ice, electricity, and sewage pumpout. A 220-foot marine railway and a 30-ton lift are available for hull and engine repairs.
              </p>
              <p>Poultney River, not navigable, flows into the E side of Lake Champlain about 1 mile north of Whitehall. The State boundary between New York and Vermont follows Lake Champlain from the mouth of Poultney River North to the International boundary.
            </p>
            <p>Marinas in the stretch from Whitehall to Port Henry are at Chipman Point 19 miles north of Whitehall, 1.5 miles north of Chipman Point, and at the mouth of Hospital Creek opposite Port Henry. The usual services and travelifts to 20 tons are available.
            </p>
            <p>La Chute is a creek that flows into the west side of the lake about 22 miles north of Whitehall. The approach to the creek is very shoal and weedy and is not recommended for other than small outboards, which can navigate the creek for 1 mile during high stages. Fort Ticonderoga, on the point east of the creek mouth, is prominent from the lake.
            </p>
            <p>Cable ferry.–Fort Ticonderoga Ferry crosses the lake about 1.7 miles above La Chute. The ferry barge is towed by a tug and guided across the lake by two cables which are fixed on either shore. Passing through guides and carrier wheels on the ferry, the cables are dropped to the bottom astern and picked up ahead. The cables reach the bottom about 400 feet from either end of the ferry thus allowing vessels to pass by the moving ferry. The tug and barge are marked by lights, and signs on both and along the shore warn vessels of the presence of the ferry and the cables. Extreme caution is advised when passing the cable ferry. The ferry should never be passed close-by.
            </p>
            <p>A special anchorage is on the west side of the lake just south of the ferry crossing. (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.8(a), chapter 2, for limits and regulations.)
            </p>
            <p>Port Henry, NY, is on the west side of Lake Champlain at the south end of the wide section, about 39 miles north of Whitehall. Channels.–A dredged basin along the harbor front is entered from south. The east side of the entrance is marked by a buoy that marks the south end of the shoals that border the east side of the basin. At the north end of the harbor, a 500-foot pier of the New York State Canal System extends southeast from shore and is marked at the outer end by a private light. The pier also serves as a breakwater to protect the harbor from north. A State-dredged channel leads from deep water west to the terminal. In 1967, the maximum depth available in the harbor basin and barge canal terminal channel was 12 feet.</p></p>

                <p>Burlington, VT, just north of the entrance to Shelburne Bay, is the largest port on Lake Champlain. Several companies have dock facilities for receipt of petroleum products by barge. The Hilton Hotel, with a red lighted sign, is the most prominent object in the harbor approach.
                </p>
                <p>Burlington Breakwater North Light (44°28'50"N., 73°13'47"W.), 35 feet above the water, is shown from a white square lighthouse on the north end of the N breakwater. Channels–Two detached breakwaters parallel the shore and protect the harbor front from west. Lights are on the north end of the north breakwater and on the south end of the south breakwater, and a daybeacon marks the north side of the gap between them. Depths in the harbor are 6 to 12 feet off the wharves increasing to much greater depths at the breakwaters. Good anchorage is available behind the breakwaters.
                </p>
                <p>Anchorages–A special anchorage area for vessels less than 65 feet in length is about 0.2 mile northeast of Burlington Breakwater South Light. (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.8(h), chapter 2, for limits and regulations.) A special anchorage area for vessels less than 35 feet is off the east side of the south breakwater. (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.136, chapter 2, for limits and regulations.) Coast Guard–Burlington Coast Guard Station is at the north end of the harbor, east of Burlington Breakwater North Light.
                </p>
                <p>Harbor regulations–Harbor regulations are established by the Burlington City Council and are enforced by the harbormaster, who may be reached at City Hall. A speed limit of 5 mph is enforced in the city yacht basin. Copies of the regulations may be obtained from the Mayor, City Hall, Burlington, VT 05401.
                </p>
                <p>Small-craft facilities–Marinas in the city yacht basin 0.6 mile southeast of Burlington Breakwater North Light provide transient berths, gasoline, diesel fuel, water, ice, electricity, and a launching ramp.
                </p>
                <p>Ferry–Passenger and automobile ferries operate seasonally between Burlington and Port Kent, NY, 10 miles west-northwest.
                </p>
                <p>Caution–An operations area for amphibious and air rescue training is in midlake west of Burlington, bounded generally by Schuyler Reef, Appletree Shoal, Juniper Island, and The Four Brothers. The using agency is Plattsburgh Air Force Base.</p>

                Grand Isle or South Hero Island, North Hero Island, and Alburg Tongue
divide the north part of Lake Champlain into two arms. Missisquoi Bay is
at the north end of the east arm, and Riviere Richelieu flows north from
the west arm.
Lamoille River, 2.8 miles north of Mallets Bay, is navigable at low stages
only by motorboats drawing 1 to 2 feet. The channel through the fixed
span of the bridge that connects the south end of Grand Isle with the
mainland had a reported controlling depth of less than 2 feet in 1977.
Missisquoi River, flowing into the south side of Missisquoi Bay, is
navigable at low stages by motorboats drawing 1 to 2 feet for about 6
miles to Swanton. Dead Creek, the alternate entrance to the river, has
depths of 2 to 12 feet.
Marinas are in the east arm of the north end of Lake Champlain on the
southeast side of Grand Isle, at the northeast end of Burton Island on
the west side of St. Albans Bay, in City Bay on the east side of North
Hero Island, and on the east side of Alburg Passage. Lifts handling boats
to 25 feet are available.
A special anchorage is at the head of St. Albans Bay. (See 33 CFR 110.1
and 110.8(f), chapter 2, for limits and regulations.)
Great Chazy River flows into the west side of Lake Champlain about 4
miles south of Rouses Point, NY. The entrance to the river is marked by
private lighted and unlighted buoys. The river is navigable at low stages
by small boats drawing 2 to 3 feet for about 6 miles to Champlain. In
2003, the controlling depth in the entrance channel was 1.2 feet. In
1977, a depth of 5 feet was reported to be available to the marina 0.5
mile above the mouth.
Marinas are: on the west side of Treadwell Bay in the small bight Bay St
Armand (44°44'54"N., 73°24'50"W.); in Mooney Bay opposite the south
end of North Hero Island (44°47'13"N., 73°21'55"W.); and 0.5 mile
above the mouth of the Great Chazy River. Gasoline, transient berths,
pump-out, and lifts to 50 tons are availab</p>

                Willsboro Bay, on the west side of the lake west of The Four Brothers, is
                enclosed on the east by Willsboro Point. Marinas on the east side of the
                bay provide transient berths, gasoline, diesel fuel, electricity, ice,
                sewage pump-out, mast-stepping service, launching ramps, and hull and
                engine repairs.
                </p>
                <p>Shelburne Bay, east of The Four Brothers, is enclosed on the west by
                Shelburne Point. Two special anchorages are on the west side of the
                bay. (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.8(c) and (c–1), chapter 2, for limits and
                regulations.) A boatyard on the west side of the bay provides berths,
                gas, diesel fuel, water, ice, electricity, and sewage pump-out. A 220-ft
                marine railway and a 30-ton lift are available for hull and engine repairs.
                </p>
                <p>Burlington, VT, just north of the entrance to Shelburne Bay, is the
                largest port on Lake Champlain. Several companies have dock facilities
                for receipt of petroleum products by barge. The Hilton Hotel, with a red
                lighted sign, is the most prominent object in the harbor approach.
                Burlington Breakwater North Light (44°28'50"N., 73°13'47"W.), 35 feet
                above the water, is shown from a white square lighthouse on the north
                end of the N breakwater.
                </p>
                <p>Channels.–Two detached breakwaters parallel the shore and protect the
                harbor front from west. Lights are on the north end of the north
                breakwater and on the south end of the south breakwater, and a
                daybeacon marks the north side of the gap between them. Depths in the
                harbor are 6 to 12 feet off the wharves increasing to much greater
                depths at the breakwaters. Good anchorage is available behind the
                breakwaters.
                </p>
                <p>Anchorages.–A special anchorage area for vessels less than 65 feet in
                length is about 0.2 mile northeast of Burlington Breakwater South Light.
                (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.8(h), chapter 2, for limits and regulations.)
                Aspecial anchorage area for vessels less than 35 feet is off the east side
                of the south breakwater. (See 33 CFR 110.1 and 110.136, chapter 2, for
                limits and regulations.)
                </p>
                <p>Coast Guard.–Burlington Coast Guard Station is at the north end of the
                harbor, east of Burlington Breakwater North Light.
                Harbor regulations.–Harbor regulations are established by the
                Burlington City Council and are enforced by the harbormaster who may
                be reached at City Hall. A speed limit of 5 mph is enforced in the city
                yacht basin. Copies of the regulations may be obtained from the Mayor,
                City Hall, Burlington, VT 05401.
